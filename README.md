Rockville City Power Bi Dashboard PDF version
  This project is in junction With the City of Rockville Planning commission. I was tasked with the opportunity to create a dashboard that highliights some key health matrics of Rockville City and compares them with other State and Natioanl Cities. Overall, most of the metrics point to the health of Rockville City being very good. From physical environment, to social factors, to health outcomes of the residents, Rockville city scores high marks in regard to being a healthy city.

Added the Power Bi files to the Github

Added a screen shot of the table view where data cleaning and metric selection is done.
